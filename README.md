## Contributing

This site is built with [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and depends on [@vue/theme](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-theme). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`.

For local development, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as optional chaining.
